# panza
pygame game loosely inspired by archon

# motivation
write a little game where two tanks can shoot each other.  
why tanks? tanks are cool. at least the pixel ones ...  

the tanks shall be controlled by two gamepads:  
* left trigger for the tank's movement
* right trigger for the gun
* don't forget the fire button

keep the project minimal and try to achieve good readability.  
could a ten years old kid understand it?
